Feature: search bar functionality
Title: test search results after the search button is pressed.
Description: Given I'm an user logged, when I type {variable text} in the Home search bar, then the results matches the search query.
Preconditions: Have an account created and be logged in.
Steps:
    1- Click on the search bar
    2- Type: {variable text}
    3- Click on the "search button"

Expected conditions:
    1- The title of the browser's tab should be the same as the text searched -> {variable text}
    2- The results that appears in the center of the page should be related with the text searched. They should contains {variable text} on theirs attributes.


Other tests cases that can apply for testing the search bar functionality can be:
    1- if the user story says that there are some forbidden characters -> prepare test cases to cover the different scenarios
    2- if there is a min/ max number of characters -> prepare test cases for those scenarios
